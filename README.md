# enterprise-data-insights-architecture

The Enterprise Data & Insights Architecture repository is a collection of frameworks, reference models, data patterns, and reusable assets designed for architects, data engineers, and analytics professionals.

It brings together Enterprise Architecture principles and Data Architecture practices to provide a unified view of how organizations can design, govern, and implement scalable, secure, and insight-driven data platforms.

📂 Concepts (Data & Enterprise Architecture):
  Data architecture.
  Enterprise architecture.
  
📂 Architecture Blueprints:
  Conceptual diagrams (enterprise data flow, business-to-technical mapping).
  Logical & physical data models (ER diagrams, schema definitions).
  Cloud deployment patterns (AWS, Azure, GCP examples).
  Medallion architecture / Data Lakehouse design (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).

📂 Data Models:
  Relational model.
  ER model.
  Dimensional models (Kimball, Star/Snowflake, Inmon, EDW).
  Data Vault models
  Conanical model.
  Domain-driven designs (banking, retail, healthcare, etc.).
  Reusable templates for schema design.

📂 Code & Automation:
  ETL/ELT pipeline scripts (Python, PySpark, dbt, Airflow, etc.).
  Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Bicep).
  Reusable SQL scripts (DDL, stored procedures, optimization patterns).
  Automation for metadata management & lineage.
  
📂 Analytics & Insights:
  Dashboards & BI templates (Qlik, Power BI, Tableau).
  Advanced analytics notebooks (Jupyter/PySpark notebooks for forecasting, ML, segmentation).
  Reusable KPI frameworks (financial metrics, operational metrics, domain-specific KPIs).

📂 Governance & Standards:
  Data quality rules & frameworks.
  Data catalog integration guidelines.
  Best practices for master data management (MDM).
  Glossary of business terms (Data Dictionary).

📂 Use Case Implementations:
  End-to-end examples:
  Customer 360.
  Fraud detection analytics.
  Sales & revenue forecasting.
  Regulatory reporting (e.g., Basel 3, GDPR, HIPAA compliance).

📂 References & Learning:
  Whitepapers, standards, and industry frameworks (TOGAF, DAMA-DMBOK).
